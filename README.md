# Secret Bidding System
This is a Python script for a secret bidding system. Users can input their name and bid amount, and the script will determine the highest bidder.I created this auction program to dive deep into key programming concepts, including dictionaries, lists, functions, and the use of the 'OS' module for clearing the console screen.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
  https://github.com/saif-islam123/-silent_auction_program
2. cd secret-bidding-system
3. python secret_bidding.py

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- os module (pre-installed with Python)
## How it Works

1. **Start the Program:**
   - Run the script `secret_bidding.py`.
   - The program will display a welcome message.

2. **Enter Bids:**
   - Each participant enters their name and bid amount.
   - The program will ask if there are any other bidders.

3. **Determine the Winner:**
   - Once there are no more bidders, the program will determine the highest bid and announce the winner.
